# HackerNews_post_activity
This project aims to determine what kind of posts are more popular and get more interaction. It also determines what time of the day is the best time to post. 
I used pandas for data wrangling and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations to show variation in post comments with the time of day.

Hacker News is my case-study news site.
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. 
Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

## Insights

Though Show HN posts were more than Ask HN posts, Ask HN posts receive more activity than Show HN posts. This may because these posts ask questions. 
Questions attract answers in form of comments on the Hacker News platform

Ask HN posts get more activity at 15:00 Eastern time
Show HN posts get more activity at 16:00 Eastern time

I found that peak time for ordinary posts (i.e not Ask HN or Show HN) is between 12:00 to 20:00 Eastern time and that these posts receive less activity in the early 
hours of the day.
